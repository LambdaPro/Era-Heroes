# Era-Heroes
Online Multiplayer RPG Concept

Edit: 2/24/2020 - The code on this project is very old & I was in a more so learning stage so the code is bad and not ideal. So it shouldn't be a reference of my current coding style.

This project was 100% for practice.  I was trying to see what type of game I could create using mainly PHP as the key tool.  My final verdict is that I will not ever use PHP again the way I did for this project.  

The pros are that I learned A LOT while doing this.  Although, I won't apply what I learned to this project; I will apply everything new that I now understand into future projects.  I will definitly redo this but with different programming languages.

# What is it?
It's suppose to be a online game where you can spawn on a map, see other players and battle them.

You technically can do all that, although it's not perfect... it does work.

-> Login system

-> Chat system

-> View users stats

-> Create rooms

-> Explore game lobbies

-> Challenge other players if both of your coordinates are equal

-> Gain levels

I won't be updating it any further, but as I said... I will re-visit this as a new project in the far future.
